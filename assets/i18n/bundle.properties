basisuTtContainer = Texture file container. KTX2 is an open standard from the Khronos group \
  and is generally recommended over the Basis file container, which is old, Basis Universal own format.
basisuTtTextureFormat = ETC1S is a medium/low quality mode and outputs very small files. \
  UASTC is heavy and for extremely high quality textures.
basisuTtQuality = Controls the output quality of ETC1S texture. \
  You need to experiment with the quality level on your content. \
  This will affect the size of the file as well.
basisuTtCompression = ETC1S compression level (higher is slower). \
  This parameter controls numerous internal encoding speed vs. compression efficiency/performance tradeoffs. \
  Note this is NOT the same as the ETC1S quality level, and most users shouldn't change this.

dBasisuAboutHead0 = Basis Universal project
dBasisuAboutDesc0 = Basis Universal is a GPU texture codec that outputs a highly compressed intermediate file format [light-grey].ktx2[] (super-compressed) or [light-grey].basis[]. \
  An intermediate texture then can be quickly transcoded to a very wide variety of GPU compressed and uncompressed pixel formats. \
  It helps to save lots of video memory on runtime by dynamically selecting the compressed texture format that is best suited for your current GPU.
dBasisuAboutHead1 = Basis Universal libGDX library
dBasisuAboutDesc1 = To load [light-grey].ktx2[]/[light-grey].basis[] texture files in your libGDX project, you will need [text-yellow]gdx-basis-universal[] library.
